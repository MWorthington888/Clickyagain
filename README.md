Developers notes:
----------------

This app was written to show the working relationships between Components and the App.js

Components were created from templates from Stu_HelloBootstrap and Stu_FriendRefactor activities (Week 19 Activities 18 and 29 respectively). 

This app is deployed remotely to Heroku.

Known Bugs to fix
---------------
There is an issue with the TopScores updating when a new top score is achieved. I will continue to work on this issue.
